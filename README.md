This model has been constructed as part of the ongoing, multi-institutional project entitled
Combatting African Animal Trypanosomiasis (COMBAAT). The key aims of the model are to understand
the means by which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emerges in response to treatment and 
prophylaxis, how this spreads throughout the population, and what role wildlife play in the
maintinence or loss of this AMR. 
<br><br>
This model is <b>currently under construction</b> and as such is unsuitable for analysis as
of this moment. This README file will be updated once the model is ready for analysis with
instructions for use and information about the subdirectories of this repository.
